# Connector Sample Applications
This repo tree contains sample apps illustrating how to use the SteelToe Connectors for connecting to CloudFoundry services in your ASP.NET Core application. SteelToe Connectors simplify the coding process of binding to and accessing CloudFoundry based services.
 
* MySql - ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [MySql Connector](https://github.com/SteelToeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/SteelToe.CloudFoundry.Connector.MySql) to connect your application to a MySql database on CloudFoundry.
* MySqlEF6 - ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [MySql Connector](https://github.com/SteelToeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/SteelToe.CloudFoundry.Connector.MySql) to connect a EntityFramework6 `DbContext` to a MySql database on CloudFoundry.
* Redis - ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Redis](https://github.com/SteelToeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/SteelToe.CloudFoundry.Connector.Redis) to connect a [Microsoft Redis Cache Extension](https://github.com/aspnet/Caching/tree/dev/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Redis) to a Redis cache on CloudFoundry.
* PostgreEFCore - ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [PostgreEFCore](https://github.com/SteelToeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/SteelToe.CloudFoundry.Connector.PostgreSql)to connect a EntityFramework Core `DbContext` to a Postgres database on CloudFoundry.
* PostgreSql - ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [PostgreSql](https://github.com/SteelToeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/SteelToe.CloudFoundry.Connector.PostgreSql) to connect your application to a Postgres database on CloudFoundry.
* OAuth - ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [OAuth](https://github.com/SteelToeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/SteelToe.CloudFoundry.Connector.OAuth) to connect your application to a OAuth2 security service (e.g. [UAA Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) or [Pivotal Single Signon](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/)) on CloudFoundry.
