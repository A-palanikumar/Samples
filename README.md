# Steeltoe Sample Applications
This repo contains several sample applications illustrating how to use the Steeltoe frameworks. 

* [Configuration](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Configuration) - various samples illustrating how to use the Spring Cloud Config Server and acces CloudFoundry `VCAP_*` environment variables as configuration data.
* [Connectors](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Connectors) - several samples illustrating how to use the Steeltoe Connectors for connecting to CloudFoundry services in your ASP.NET Core application. Steeltoe Connectors simplify the coding process of binding to and accessing CloudFoundry based services.
* [Discovery](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Discovery) - sample apps illustrating how to use the Steeltoe discovery packages for Service discovery in micro services based application.
* [Security](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Security) - sample apps illustrating how to make use of the Steeltoe CloudFoundry External Security Providers for Authentication and Authorization against a CloudFoundry OAuth2 security service(e.g. UAA Server or Pivotal Single Signon). 
* [MusicStore](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/MusicStore) -  a sample app illustrating how to use all of the Steeltoe components together in a ASP.NET Core application. This application is a microservies based application built from the ASP.NET Core reference app MusicStore provided by Microsoft.
* [FreddysBBQ](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/FreddysBBQ) - a polyglot (i.e. Java and .NET) microservices based sample app illustrating interoperability between Java and .NET based microservices running on CloudFoundry, secured with OAuth2 Security Services and using Spring Cloud Services.

# Branches

All new development is done on the dev branch. More stable versions of the samples can be found on the master branch.
# Building & Running
